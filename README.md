## 🚀 Project Overview
This capstone project showcases my ability to apply both classical and modern data science techniques to real-world marketing problems. The goal was to enhance customer segmentation and retention strategies for an e-commerce company using a combination of:
- RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis
- Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)
- Clustering (K-Means)
- Classification models (Multinomial Logistic Regression, CART, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Market Basket Analysis for cross-selling insights

This end-to-end solution, including data preparation, model building, and actionable business recommendations, demonstrates the technical and strategic thinking I bring to marketing analytics and business intelligence roles.

## 👨‍💼 Role & Contributions
